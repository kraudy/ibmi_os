# IBM i operating system

This is intended to give a guideline on the eternal IBM i operating system.

The special term in computer science is **abstraction**. There are levels of abstraction, basically from the atom to the internet. 

Here, we are going to start from the silicon up to get a better understanding of what is going on behind the green screen.

Silicon has some nice properties to make transistors. With transistors, you make logical gates; these logical gates perform boolean operations, which turn into logical units that form a circuit, and in the middle we have the CPU, which has its corresponding architecture and instruction set architecture. 

We are familiar with the (*x86*)[] (*x64*)[] archs. IBM has the [*PPC64*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ppc64) processor architecture with the [*Power ISA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_ISA) instruction set architecture which is a [*RISC*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer) instruction set (yeah, RISC like [RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V]))

IBM made the first leap from the early designs of cumputers from [Harvard architecture] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture) to the [Von Neuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) single-operator machine: instruction and data shared the same memory, and instructions were fetched, decoded, and executed in a linear fashion. This was the [the IBM 701](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_701). Programs were written in low-level languajes wich made them tightly coupled to the hardware.

## Toward Higher-Level Abstraction

Due to the increase in complexity and requirements, the limitations of low-level programming became evident. That's when higher-level languages came into play (Fortran, COBOL, RPG, etc.). The compiler translated these high-level languages to machine-specific instructions. But here is the important part: *the compiled code still executed directly on the processorâ€™s native instruction set*.

There was a need for a better way to manage resources and scale; that's when the ideas of *LSI* (virtualization of storage), *HLS* (Higher Level System), and the [Future Systems project (FS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Future_Systems_project) started emerging. 

The main principle was to have a machine that natively executed high-level procedural languages (FORTRAN, COBOL, PL/i, APL, RPG) without interpretation. Needless to say, this was an incredibly ambitious project that needed a large number of breakthroughs in many areas, which led to the project being terminated.

But IBM kept the grind going. They released the [System/38](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/38) which actually had some of those ambitious ideas: programs were compiled into a high-level instruction set, which was not *interpreted* but rather *translated* into a lower-level machine instruction set to be executed (big emphasis on *translated*). This system marked a revolutionary step in architecture by introducing a high-level *machine interface* (MI) and the concept of a [Technology Independent Machine Interface (TIMI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i#TIMI).

> The operating system for the System/38 was the [Control Program Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Program_Facility). Before that IBM had the (System Support Program)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Support_Program] operating system for the [System/34](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/34) and the [System/36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/36). These were actually considered midrange computers.

The consequences of these ideas were huge: separation of high-level programming from specific instruction sets, translation of high-level instructions to low-level at compile time for no *interpretation* downtime, single-level-storage where programs, files and databases were treated as objects in the same virtual address space, and finally, a built-in relational database (DB2 Intro here coming soon). No time for losers here.

>The idea of modularization and separations at different levels of abstraction is a patter found on many areas of computer science. For example: the network stack ([OSI Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) ) and the internet ([REST arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)).

## The legendary AS/400

After that, came the famous [AS/400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AS/400) which leveraged on this idea of different levels of abstractions.

HSL permites directly job excecution or by emulation (like for the system/360)

This idea set a firm base for the future of IBM.

This also lets compile a languaje into a middle representations which in tourns is transtaled on the fly with no downtime. 

The languaje does not match the machine instruction set direclty.
